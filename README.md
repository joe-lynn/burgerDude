# burgerDude

Port of blockdude from the TI-83 to html5 using phaser.io game engine https://joe-lynn.github.io/burgerDude/

Scaling does not work for all monitors - phaser turned out to be too much overhead and geared towards non-programmers. In the end all that was used is phaser's window vs. world map view management and scaling (bad)

Project is abandoned and will be re-done without phaser
